# Walkabout

*Written with assistance by GPT-4*

Duration: 1 hour

Objective: The primary goal of this session is to teach surgical trainees to observe and identify potential pain points and frustrations within the hospital environment by focusing on the interactions between patients, providers, and staff. By the end of the session, participants should be able to:

Observe and analyze interactions in the hospital setting with a critical eye for potential pain points.
Recognize seemingly trivial frustrations that may have significant implications for patient care and overall hospital efficiency.
Document their observations effectively and systematically for further analysis and potential innovation.
Exercises:

Introduction & Briefing (10 minutes): Begin the session by explaining the purpose and goals of the walkabout. Emphasize the importance of keen observation and critical analysis, as well as the need to approach the exercise with an open mind and a focus on identifying areas for improvement.

Hospital Walkabout (30 minutes): Instruct participants to walk around the hospital independently or in pairs, focusing on observing interactions between patients, providers, and staff. Encourage them to take note of any frustrations, inefficiencies, or pain points they witness, even if they may seem minor or commonplace.

Reflection & Documentation (10 minutes): After the walkabout, have participants return to the session room and spend 10 minutes reflecting on their observations. They should document their findings, ensuring they are thorough and systematic in their descriptions. Encourage them to consider potential implications for patient care and overall hospital efficiency.

Group Discussion & Debrief (10 minutes): Gather participants together and facilitate a group discussion, during which they can share their observations and insights. Encourage participants to compare and contrast their findings, and identify common themes or particularly striking pain points that may warrant further investigation.

Opportunities for Academic Publication:

The observations and insights gathered during this session can serve as valuable contributions to the academic literature. Consider the following approaches to disseminate the findings:

Write an observational study detailing the pain points and frustrations identified during the walkabout. Discuss the implications of these issues on patient care, hospital efficiency, and provider satisfaction, and suggest potential areas for future research and innovation.

Conduct a follow-up study comparing the walkabout findings with data gathered from other sources, such as patient satisfaction surveys or staff interviews. Investigate the extent to which the observed pain points align with the experiences and perceptions of the broader hospital community.

Develop a case study or best practices guide on conducting hospital walkabouts as a method for identifying areas for innovation in healthcare. Highlight the lessons learned, challenges encountered, and potential improvements for future iterations of the exercise.

By engaging in these activities, participants can contribute to a better understanding of the challenges and opportunities for innovation in the hospital environment, ultimately helping to drive improvements in patient care and healthcare delivery.****
