Title: Complaining Rounds

Duration: 1 hour

Objective: The primary goal of this session is to provide a structured and constructive environment for surgical trainees to brainstorm and identify the frustrations and pain points they face in their daily practice. By the end of the session, participants should be able to:

Articulate their pain points and frustrations clearly and concisely.
Categorize and prioritize the identified issues.
Understand how to transform these pain points into actionable opportunities for improvement.
Exercises:

Individual Reflection (10 minutes): Begin the session by allowing participants to spend 10 minutes reflecting on their daily experiences and listing the pain points and frustrations they encounter. Encourage them to think about specific situations, interactions, and processes that contribute to these issues.

Small Group Discussion (20 minutes): Divide participants into small groups of 4-5 people. Each participant will share their list of pain points and frustrations within their group. As a group, they will discuss and identify common themes and prioritize them based on urgency and impact.

Pain Point Mapping (15 minutes): As a whole group, have each small group share their prioritized list of pain points. Create a visual map on a whiteboard or large paper, clustering similar themes and issues together. This process will help identify overarching areas of concern and opportunities for improvement.

Opportunity Identification (10 minutes): Now that the pain points have been mapped, facilitate a discussion to transform these challenges into actionable opportunities. Encourage participants to consider possible solutions or interventions that could address the identified pain points.

Next Steps & Wrap-up (5 minutes): Conclude the session by summarizing the main takeaways and discussing potential next steps. Encourage participants to stay engaged and continue the conversation beyond the session.

Opportunities for Academic Publication:

The work products of this session can be valuable contributions to academic literature. Consider the following approaches to disseminate the findings:

Write a perspective or opinion article detailing the pain points identified by surgical trainees and their implications for medical education and practice. Highlight potential areas for future research and innovation.

Develop a case study examining the process of conducting a "Complaining Rounds" session, focusing on its effectiveness in identifying and prioritizing pain points. Discuss the lessons learned and potential improvements for future iterations of the exercise.

Conduct a follow-up study to track the impact of the identified pain points on trainees' professional development and patient outcomes. Investigate whether any implemented interventions or solutions led to improvements in the identified areas of concern.

By engaging in these activities, participants can contribute to a better understanding of the challenges faced by surgical trainees and help drive improvements in medical education and practice.
